## Hi, I'm Riley ðŸ‘‹
I'm a third year computer science major at the University of Virginia with a minor in data science. I am pursuing a career in software development. 

Some of my interests are web/app development, data science, and embedded systems - I love to learn about new technologies at all levels of the stack!
