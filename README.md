## Hi, I'm Riley ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 3rd year computer science major & data science minor at the University of Virginia, and I am pursuing a career in software development.

I find interest in many fields, but the few that I especially enjoy learning about are web/mobile development, embedded systems, data science, and compilers.
