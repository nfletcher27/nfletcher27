## Hi, I'm Riley 👋
🏛️ I'm studying computer science and data science at the University of Virginia.

👨‍💻 I like to learn about full stack software development, cybersecurity, embedded systems, and data science - particularly ML.

🏙️ I am pursuing a career as a full time software engineer upon graduation.
