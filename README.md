## Hi, I'm Riley ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 3rd year computer science major & data science minor at the University of Virginia, and I am pursuing a career in software development.

I'm interested in many areas, but I especially enjoy learning about web/mobile development, embedded systems, data science, and compilers.
